## 🛍️ E-Commerce Sales Analysis using Python

### 📌 Overview

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce transaction data to extract actionable business insights. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI generation, customer segmentation, and sales trend analysis using Python.

### 📊 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw transactional data
* Explore patterns in sales, orders, and profitability
* Analyze sales performance across **categories**, **products**, and **regions**
* Generate key business KPIs
* Identify loss-making products and discount impacts
* Visualize customer behavior and sales trends

---

### 🧠 Key Insights

* 💰 **Total Sales**: \$2,261,536.78
* 🧾 **Average Order Value**: \$459.48
* 📦 **Top-selling products** and **loss-making items** identified
* 📉 Discounts >20% often lead to negative profit margins
* 🌎 Sales are highest in regions like **California**, **New York**, and **Texas**
* 🧍‍♀️ High-value customers form a small portion but drive majority of revenue
